  GD .................... A library used to create images.
  MySQL ................. MySQL is an SQL (Structured Query Language) database 
			  server. It is a client/server implementation that
			  consists of a server daemon (mysqld) and many
		          different client programs/libraries.
  PHP ................... PHP is a widely-used Open Source general-purpose
			  scripting language that is especially suited for Web
			  development and can be embedded into HTML.
  Mod_SSL ............... mod_ssl provides provides strong cryptography
			  for the Apache 1.3 webserver via the Secure
			  Sockets Layer (SSL v2/v3) and Transport Layer
			  Security (TLS v1).
  OpenSSL (referenced) .. The OpenSSL Project is a collaborative effort to
			  develop a robust, commercial-grade, fully
			  featured, and Open Source toolkit implementing
			  the Secure Sockets Layer (SSL v2/v3) and
			  Transport Layer Security (TLS v1) as well as a
			  full-strength general-purpose cryptography library.

			  which simplifies the usage of shared memory
			  between related processed under Unix platforms.
  Mod Throttle .......... (http://www.snert.com/Software/mod_throttle/) Virtual
			  server throttling for Apache 1.3.x
  WebDAV ................ (http://www.webdav.org/) WebDAV stands for
			  "Web-based Distributed Authoring and
			  Versioning". It is a set of extensions to the
			  HTTP protocol which allows users to
			  collaboratively edit and manage files on remote
			  web servers. EG: Microsoft WebFolders
  Mod FastCGI ........... (http://www.jtan.com/doc/apache/mod/mod_fastcgi.html)
			  FastCGI is a high-performance alternative to
			  CGI. FastCGI gets its speed by having the Web
			  server keep the application processes running
			  between requests. So, unlike CGI, you do not
			  have the overhead of starting up a new process
			  and doing application initialization (e.g.
			  connecting to a database) each time somebody
			  requests a document. The processes start up with
			  the Web server and keep on running.
  Mod AuthNDS ........... (http://www.users.drew.edu/~pwilson/mod_auth_nds/)
			  NDS authentication module for the Apache web
			  server *requires ncpfs 2.2.0.17+* *requires
			  kernel IPX support*
  Mod Layout ............ (http://www.tangent.org/mod_layout/) mod_layout
			  add a Footer and Header directive to Apache to
			  allow you to create a custom look and feel that
			  is enforced throughout a website. This makes it
			  easy to do portal sites with banners and footers.
  Mod GZIP .............. (www.remotecommunications.com/apache/mod_gzip)
			  mod_gzip does not require ANY software to be
			  installed on the client side. mod_gzip is a
			  standard Apache Web Server module which acts as
			  an Internet Content Accelerator. Its function in
			  life is to become an integral 'part' of any
			  existing Apache Web Server and see that the
			  content being delivered to YOU, the end-user, is
			  as small and as optimized as possible.
  Mod DynaVHost ......... (http://funkcity.com/0101/) An Apache module to
			  do Dynamic Virtual Hosting. You just need to
			  create the directory for your new name based
			  VirtualHost and the module will do the rest
  Mod Roaming ........... (http://www.klomp.org/mod_roaming/) With
			  mod_roaming you can use your Apache webserver as
			  a Netscape Roaming Access server. This allows
			  you to store your Netscape Communicator 4.5
			  preferences, bookmarks, address books, cookies
			  etc. on the server so that can access the server.
  Mod Access Ref ........ (http://accessreferer.sourceforge.net/) It is a
			  module for the Apache HTTP Server that provides
			  access control based on "Referer" HTTP header
			  content.
  Mod AuthSYS ........... (http://kw2.knightweb.com/~hsf/sources/mod_auth_sys/)
			  This module allows you use your system access
			  files (passwd and group) for www authentication.
  Mod Bandwidth ......... Provide bandwidth usage limitation either on the
		          whole server or one a per connection basis based
		  	  on the size of files, directory location or
			  remote domain/IP.
  Mod_Perl .............. (http://perl.apache.org/) With mod_perl it is
			  possible to write Apache modules entirely in
			  Perl. In addition, the persistent interpreter
			  embedded in the server avoids the overhead of
			  starting an external interpreter and the penalty
		  	  of Perl start-up time.
  Mod_Auth_LDAP ......... (http://www.muquit.com/muquit/software/mod_au
			  th_ldap/mod_auth_ldap.html) *requires OpenLDAP*
			  This module can be used for http basic
			  authentication using the user data stored in a
			  Lightweight Directory Access Protocol (LDAP) server.
  Mod_DTCL .............. (http://tcl.apache.org/index.ttml) Tcl is an
			  open source, cross-platform scripting language
			  created by John K. Ousterhout at the University
			  of California at Berkeley in 1988.
  Mod_Python ............ (http://www.modpython.org/) Mod_python is an
			  Apache module that embeds the Python interpreter
			  within the server. With mod_python you can write
			  web-based applications in Python that will run
			  many times faster than traditional CGI and will
			  have access to advanced features such as ability
			  to retain database connections and other data
			  between hits and access to Apache internals.
  Mod_Backhand .......... mod_backhand is project that allows seamless
			  redirection of HTTP requests from one web server to
			  another. This redirection can be used to target
			  machines with under-utilized resources, thus providing
			  fine-grained, per-request load balancing of web requests. 
			  A common misconception. mod_backhand may allow you
			  to better utilize your resources, but if your bottleneck
			  lies in your bandwidth, you will not be able to push
			  more information.
  mod_watch ............. watch and collect the bytes in & out per virtual 
			  host and per file owner, similar to some 
			  information collected by routers, switches, and 
			  network interfaces. This module was designed for 
			  use with MRTG, which will make nice graphical 
			  representations of the data. 
  mod_trigger ........... The point of mod_trigger is to give you hooks 
			  into each Apache request to launch triggers if 
			  certain actions occur. You specify the actions 
			  through directives that mod_trigger adds to the 
			  webserver.
  mod_filter ............ This module was designed to allow you to filter 
			  outgoing content from your webserver. This works 
			  with PHP, Jserv, Mod_perl, standard CGI's, and 
			  probably even your custom handlers.
  mod_index_rss ......... This module provides RSS output for directories.
			  Sites that publish mainly static content to
			  directories (whether images, html...) can use it
			  to have dynamic lists of their content. 
  mod_mp3 ............... This turns apache into your basic RIAA hating, but every
			  college student loving mp3 streaming server. It can play
			  from a list of files, either straight through or
			  randomly. It can also be used to cache mp3's into memory
			  and have the server operate entirely from memory.
