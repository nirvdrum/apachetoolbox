# http://www.klomp.org/mod_roaming/
#RoamingAlias /roaming /usr/local/apache/roaming
#   
#   The first argument is the uri prefix that mod_roaming will respond
#   to, the second argument is the directory where the roaming access  
#   files will be stored. Make sure the webserver has write permissions
#   to this directory. Preferrably, no other user should have read or
#   write permissions to this directory to protect the privacy of the
#   users.
#   
#   A subdirectory is automatically created for each user, e.g. the
#   roaming access files for user vinny will be stored under
#/usr/local/apache/roaming/vinny
#   and can be accessed via
#http://<host>/roaming/vinny/...
#   
#   Make sure that any requests made to the roaming directory are
#   authorized. You can do this in a number of different ways:   
#   a. by putting a .htaccess file in the roaming directory (e.g.
#      /usr/local/apache/roaming). If you do this, make sure
#      Apache is reading the .htaccess file and the directives in it
#      are allowed (AllowOverride AuthConfig),
#   b. by putting a
#      <Directory /usr/local/apache/roaming>
#      block in httpd.conf, or
#   c. by putting a
#      <Location /roaming> 
#      block in httpd.conf.
#   
#   This file or block should contains something like this:
#AuthUserFile /usr/local/apache/conf/roaming-htpasswd
#AuthType Basic
#AuthName \"Roaming Access\"
#<Limit GET PUT MOVE DELETE>
#        require valid-user
#</Limit>
