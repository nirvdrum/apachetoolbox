		Updated Apache, mod_ssl, and MySQL to their

		the frontpage binaries ~must~ be copied to
		/usr/local, so you much have root access on the
		system to install them.  There is still a bug
		when you use both mod_frontpage and mod_ssl 
		together.  It's a problem with the patch, not
		the modules.

v1.5.50		01/07/02
		Updated to PHP 4.1.1.

v1.5.49		12/20/01
		SSL support was always built into PHP if openssl

v1.5.47		12/13/01
		Deleted my devel config.cache file from the distro,
		forgot to delete it! Small bug fix with the GD
		module.

v1.5.46		12/12/01
		Added patches sent in by Bruno Kerouanton
		<bruno.kerouanton@intexxia.com>. He added support
		for Oracle 8i in PHP. He also fixed a small bug
		in the OpenSSL ATB module.  He also added code
		so root ~can not~ run the remote update (-u) for
		security reasons.  Huge thanks!
		I updated ATB for PHPH 4.1.0 support.

v1.5.45		11/28/01
		Huge changes to the ATB mysql module. combined the
		etc/versions.conf file with the default.conf file.

		11/27/01
		Updated mod_mp3, mysql to their latest stable versions.
		Made a patch for the frontpage 2002 apache patch so
		it'll work with apache v1.3.22. Thanks to hexen for
		pointing me in the right direction! Updated APC to
		the latest version also. fixed a little bug in the
		mod_mp3 ATB module. Changed the way files are
		checked for corruption, now only if the MD5 checksum
		doesn't exist it'll use gunzip -t to test for
		corruption.

v1.5.44		10/29/01
		Updated the version of mysql, fixed the mysql download
		location as well. thanks to Nico Foltinek for sending
		me a nice email about the bugs :) Tru64 should be 
		detected from etc/external.conf as well, untested.

v1.5.43		10/24/01
		small bug with install.sh using the notice() function,
		the bug didn't cause any problems with compiling or 
		installing.

v1.5.42		10/21/01
		Code cleanup, added comments. help menu temp fix.

		10/20/01
		Bug fixes and code cleanup.  wget installation supports
		the global installation path now.

		10/19/01
		Added support to hack the reported version, product,
		support site, and vendor name of apache before it's
		compiled.  Anyone wanna run "IIS version 6beta" on
		"Palm OS3"? Screw with netcraft :) mod_ssl finally
		came out for apache v1.3.22. updated ATB for it.
		I'm currently at SANS[.org] in San Diago hacking
		away on ATB from their wireless lan! Excellent.

		./install.sh --nocolor to disable all color.
		
v1.5.41		10/12/01
		Added support for CYGWIN under NT5, updated support for 
		Apache v1.3.22. ./install.sh -c no longer deletes the

		ATB modules, thanks goes out to Stephen Lawrence for the
		feedback!

v1.5.39		09/18/01
		Bugfixes with t1libs and logging in the GD module. Added a
		symlink to the freetype2 headers from the GD source, some 
		systems needed it to compile GD.

  --		09/11/01
		My thoughts go out to the innocent people murdered today in
		New York.

v1.5.38		08/22/01
		More bugfixes with PHP+PDFlibs. The PDFlibs require zlib, 
		libjpeg, and libtiff support to be added to PHP or it wont
		work.  Removed the tcp_wrappers support in MySQL, it was
		causing too many problems for Redhat 7.x users.  You can
		manually add it back in by simply editing the bin/mysql ATB
		module.

v1.5.37		08/21/01
		Fixed a bug with PHP+bcmath. Updated APC and MING to the latest
		versions. Ming is now compiled into PHP's source instead of
		using the binary shared object via php.ini.  FrontBase SQL
		support added to PHP.  As long as it's installed ATB should
		be able to find it. Look at the bin/php-frontbase source
		for the installation paths that are probed. Added HP-UX to
		the OS detection system. Removed the shared line from PHP+PDF, 
		I also updated libpdf to 4.0.1, consider the ATB module a beta!

v1.5.36		08/20/01
		Bug fixes for bin/gd because of the new $LOCAL_PATH patch sent
		in by John Johnson <jjohn@mail.sirinet.net>. Thanks! I took out
		the arial TTF for the freetype PHP code example, I felt it
		was a waste of 200k.


v1.5.35		08/14/01
		Updated mod_layout. Included fixes provided by
		s.cramatte@shanghai.fr for imap. Added a patch provided by
		bonis@bonis.de to change the global installation prefix of
		/usr/local. Updated APC and MySQL.

v1.5.34		07/23/01
		Updated mod_layout, mod_mp3, and the version of curl that comes
		with the script+source tarball.

		07/12/01
		Updated LibCurl

v1.5.33		07/11/01
		Updated PHP3 to 3.0.18. this is a stable release with GD 2.0
		support.

v1.5.33[beta]	07/09/01
		I'm happy with the new GD setup finally. Fixed an issue with
		the T1 libs and missing LaTeX.  Freetype fonts are now finally
		working in PHP with the GD v2!

		07/06/01
		Updated to GD 2.0.1 for truecolor and freetype support. Still
		debugging and playing around.

v1.5.32		06/27/01
		Added support for BCMath functions in PHP. PHP will now automatically
		try to autodetect openssl and configure support for it. Added
		TrueType1 support to GD. updated the -c [--clean] switch to delete
		the installwatch binaries, logs, and config.cache as well. 
		Updated freetype to the latest version.

		06/26/01
		Added the following (autodetection) to PHP: Ingres II, InterBase,
		Velocis, and mnGoSearch support. Also added System V semaphore and
		System V shared memory support for PHP.

v1.5.31		06/25/01
		Updated PHP to v4.0.6, updated mod_layout and added a bugfix for it.
		Updated APC, mod_backhand, mod_mp3. Gave the GD section a big make
		over, I've verified that JPG, PNG, WBMP, and ZLIB support work via
		the phpinfo() function. mod_mp3 is still beta, I personally couldn't
		get it to compile myself. I also added a --clean [-c] switch to
		install.sh by request.  This will clean up the src/ directory and
		force ApacheToolbox to recompile everything, but it wont delete
		any of the source'es you've already downloaded.

v1.5.30		06/12/01
		Changed the script interpreter to bash from sh.  Solaris and
		the BSD's where just having too many problems with it and had
		to switch to bash anyways. Updated APC to v1.0.10. This probably
		wont effect 99% of all Linux users, BSD/Solaris users need the bash
		binary in /bin, or just edit install.sh and point it to where ever
		you keep bash (/usr/local/bin ?). `fine / -name bash` should find
		it. Fixed the help (item 99) bug to.

v1.5.29		06/05/01
		Ming support has been added. Disabled IPv6, it isn't updated
		for Apache v1.3.20 yet.

		06/04/01
		Little bugfix in the PHP menu, thanks Kevin!  Added cURL support
		to PHP. Updated wget to v1.7. Adding Ming support.

v1.5.28		06/04/01
		Updated mod_mp3 to v0.19, it is still in beta, IMMV. 
		More work on Jakarta.  The new servletapi just doesn't seem to
		want to compile the JavaDoc section, so i just removed it to
		get on with jakarta. Added more doc's to the default httpd.conf
		about mod_jserv.  Time to release it!

		06/02/01
		Added full support for Frontpage 2002 extensions.  Apache module
		patch as well as the required binaries at /usr/local/frontpage.
		This means the script+sources tarball just got 10megs larger, damn.
		Updated mysql to 3.23.38. I also changed the apache mirror to one
		that gets updated.

		06/01/01
		Updated jakarta-tomcat and jakarta-ant. bux fixes to.  working up
		updating mod_frontpage for FrontPage 2002 support.

		05/30/01
		Updated openldap to v2.0.11. Fixed the download path for j2sdk.

		05/29/01
		added the WGETOPTIONS in etc/defaults.conf by request. More
		testing, mostly on FreeBSD42. Updated JAXP to v1.1 and
		Jakarta-Ant to v1.3 .

		05/24/01
		Finally broke down and went through all my code, line by line
		, and updated the echo statements that weren't working with
		sh in Solaris or BSD.  No more need to change #!/bin/sh to
		#!/bin/bash, or update sh.  It's safe to assume I probably
		missed a couple, so expect more releases with bug fixes.

		05/23/01
		Added patches sent in by Kevin J. Menard, Jr. <kmenard@WPI.EDU>
		for mod_auth_pam and mod_auth_kerb. I'd also like to thank
		him for all the help he's given others on the support forum!
		Thanks!! Updated mod_layout, it works great once again.

v1.5.27		05/20/01
		Updated apache and mod_ssl. the mod_frontpage hack still works.

		05/19/01
		Added the current path and /opt/sfw/bin when searching for
		common programs like lynx and wget. Added $detection=$FALSE
		in etc/defaults.conf so that, by default, the OS isn't detected.
		Changed the php+imap mod to look for SunOS instead of Solaris to
		compile it with the correct type. Playing with apache 1.3.20.

v1.5.26		05/18/01
		Bug fix with the extra INCLUDES introduced in v1.5.25.

v1.5.25		05/17/01
		removed the --enable-assembler switch in mysql.  it was
		causing problems on openbsd. added a search for
		/usr/bin/openssl because the openssl MDK rpm wasn't being
		found. Added support for Apache's layout option. It's in
		the apache submenu.

		05/16/01
		Fixed a bug in bin/save-settings. Added a little note and
		example about CPAN when the perl module requirements for
		mod_perl are not ment. Added a note about the required
		frontpage binaries for mod_frontpage. Added some fixes for
		unixODBC when X wasn't on the system.  Removed mod_mp3, 0.16
		(beta) isn't working well at the moment. Fixed a bug with
		freetype and only compiling under linux.

v1.5.24		05/08/01
		Freetype bug with BSD (gmake) fixed. Mod_Layout, mod_ssl, and
		libmcrypt where updated.  Arch detected with 'uname -m' for the
		mysql install instead of `arch` now.  Fixed a bug with disabling
		default apache mods in the menu.  I added the contrib directory 
		to the tarball for the buildrpm program.

v1.5.23		05/01/01
		Huge bug in one of my functions that was cause huge problems.
		Other then the bugfix there was no other changes.

v1.5.22		05/01/01
		Updated PHP to v4.0.5. Also updated the APC source, I really
		wish they put the version number in the tarball like
		everyone else. :) Made a little change to bin/gd, 
		--with-jpeg-dir (in the PHP configuration) now points
		to the jpeg source dir in src/.

		04/20/01
		Fixed the bug with the standard apache mods. now if
		they aren't selected they get --disable-mod like they
		should.

		04/17/01
		fixed a bug with mod_dir in the apache menu, thanks to
		Greg Cope for letting me know and sending in a patch!

v1.5.21		04/11/01
		updated openssl to 0.9.6a. Some bug fixes with the way
		mod_frontpage was setup, thanks goes to al from the support
		forum for pointing it out. I'm actually commenting my code

		to help encourage patch submission. huge amounts of code
		cleanup, and I'm finding little bugs here and there to.
		nothing too serious.. yet :)

		a check for that in to, it'll set it up if you don't have it
		installed. tested on redhat62+debian.

v1.5.19		04/03/01
		Kevin J. Menard, Jr. sent in a new mod_auth_mysql module for
		atb! It works great after a few changes. I'll be adding it to
		1.5.19 for sure.  I prefer to just use php for mysql auth but
		its another module in the list :)

		04/02/01
		more updates and testing for the new mysql install. found and
		killed some bugs

		03/30/01
		updated mod_ssl to v2.8.2.  huge changes to the mysql install.
		Many thanks to Greg Cope <gjjc@rubberplant.freeserve.co.uk>
		for sending in hacks to add mysql user/group support as well
		as a ton of optimizations for the x86 platform. Still testing
		most of them. updated mysql to v3.23.36 also.

v1.5.18		03/26/01
		added support to automatically detect if openssl is installed
		and then test it for at least v0.9.6 for php.  right now

		Changed the layout of my CHANGE log. Also added another search
		path for php+postgres.

v1.5.13a	03/07/01

		even gone through yet.
